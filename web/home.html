for next generation wireless networks. Our network
coding (NC) architecture uses a flexible thread-based design, with each
encoder-decoder instance applying systematic intra-session random linear 
network coding as a packet erasure code at the IP layer. Using GENI
WiMAX platforms, a series of point-to-point transmission experiments
were conducted to compare the performance of the NC architecture
to that of the Automatic Repeated reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ
(HARQ) mechanisms. In our scenarios, the proposed architecture is able
to decrease packet loss from around 11-32% to nearly 0%; compared to
HARQ and joint HARQ/ARQ mechanisms, the NC architecture offers
up to 5.9 times gain in throughput and 5.5 times reduction in end-to-end 
file transfer delay. By establishing NC as a potential substitute for
HARQ/ARQ, our experiments offer important insights into cross-layer
designs of next generation wireless networks.</p><div style="text-align: center;" class="row"><img src="./img/BS_SS_web.png" style="max-width:40%"/></div><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 27px;" class="lead"> Click <b>New Experiment</b> Tab to start a new experiment now.</p></div>
